### Automated Savings Distribution

```python
# Weekly savings budget
weekly_budget = Decimal("400.00")

# Distribute based on urgency and priority
allocations = {
    laptop_goal: Decimal("150.00"),   # 37.5% - most urgent
    vacation_goal: Decimal("200.00"), # 50% - medium priority  
    house_goal: Decimal("50.00")      # 12.5% - long-term
}

# Simulate weekly contributions
for week in range(1, 13):  # 3 months
    for goal_id, amount in allocations.items():
        completed, notification = tracker.update_goal_progress(goal_id, amount)
        if completed:
            print(f"üéâ Goal completed: {tracker.goals[goal_id].title}")
```

### Advanced Analytics Usage

```python
# Get comprehensive analytics for a goal
analytics = tracker.get_goal_analytics(goal_id)

# Check if user is on track
goal_info = analytics['goal_info']
time_info = analytics['time_analytics']
progress_info = analytics['progress_analytics']

print(f"Goal: {goal_info['title']}")
print(f"Progress: {progress_info['completion_percentage']:.1f}%")
print(f"On track: {'Yes' if progress_info['on_track'] else 'No'}")
print(f"Required daily savings: ${time_info['required_daily_savings']}")

# Export complete user data
user_data_json = tracker.export_user_data("user123")
data = json.loads(user_data_json)
print(f"Total goals: {data['summary']['total_goals']}")
print(f"Total saved: ${data['summary']['total_saved_amount']}")
```

## üè¶ Integration with Banking Systems

### API Endpoints

The system is designed to integrate easily with REST APIs. Here are suggested endpoints:

```
POST   /api/v1/users/{user_id}/goals          # Create goal
GET    /api/v1/users/{user_id}/goals          # List goals
PUT    /api/v1/users/{user_id}/goals/{goal_id}/progress  # Update progress
GET    /api/v1/users/{user_id}/goals/{goal_id}/analytics # Get analytics
DELETE /api/v1/users/{user_id}/goals/{goal_id} # Cancel goal
GET    /api/v1/users/{user_id}/notifications   # Get notifications
POST   /api/v1/notifications/check-deadlines   # Check all deadlines
```

### Database Integration

The system can be easily adapted to work with databases by:

1. Replacing in-memory storage with database models
2. Adding persistence methods to each class
3. Implementing database transactions for consistency
4. Adding database migrations for schema changes

### Mobile App Integration

Key integration points for mobile banking apps:

#### Push Notifications
```python
# Example: Send push notification when deadline approaches
notifications = tracker.check_approaching_deadlines()
for notification in notifications:
    push_notification_service.send(
        user_id=notification.user_id,
        title="Savings Goal Deadline",
        body=notification.message,
        data={"goal_id": notification.goal_id}
    )
```

#### Real-time Updates
```python
# Example: Update goal progress from account transactions
def on_transaction(user_id, transaction):
    if transaction.category == "transfer_to_savings":
        # Find associated goal and update progress
        goal_id = find_goal_for_transaction(transaction)
        if goal_id:
            tracker.update_goal_progress(goal_id, transaction.amount)
```

#### Gamification Features
```python
# Example: Achievement system
def check_achievements(user_id):
    user_goals = tracker.get_user_goals(user_id)
    completed_goals = [g for g in user_goals if g.status == GoalStatus.COMPLETED]
    
    if len(completed_goals) == 1:
        award_badge(user_id, "first_goal_completed")
    elif len(completed_goals) == 5:
        award_badge(user_id, "goal_achiever")
    elif len(completed_goals) == 10:
        award_badge(user_id, "savings_master")
```
