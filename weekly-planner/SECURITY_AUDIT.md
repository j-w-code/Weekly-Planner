## 🔐 Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Credentials Management ✅

**Before:**
- Hardcoded API keys in `config.js`
- Exposed credentials in source control

**After:**
- ✅ All credentials moved to environment variables
- ✅ `.env` properly gitignored
- ✅ Enhanced validation with detailed error messages
- ✅ Example file (`.env.example`) with clear instructions
- ✅ Production logs sanitized to hide credentials

**Risk Level:** CRITICAL → RESOLVED

---

### 2. Input Validation ✅

**Implemented:**
- ✅ Event title length validation (max 255 chars)
- ✅ Date/time validation (end after start)
- ✅ Event duration validation (max 24 hours)
- ✅ Form sanitization for all user inputs
- ✅ Client-side validation before API calls

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM → RESOLVED

---

### 3. Error Handling ✅

**Implemented:**
- ✅ Error Boundary component for graceful error recovery
- ✅ Sanitized error messages (no stack traces in production)
- ✅ User-friendly error notifications
- ✅ Development vs production error logging
- ✅ No sensitive data in error messages

**Risk Level:** HIGH → RESOLVED

---

### 4. Authentication & Authorization ✅

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Google OAuth 2.0 integration
- ✅ Token-based authentication
- ✅ Proper scope management (`calendar` not `calendar.readonly`)
- ✅ Secure token storage (handled by Google API)
- ✅ Sign-out functionality with token revocation

**Security Features:**
- Uses industry-standard OAuth 2.0
- No password storage required
- Tokens managed by Google's infrastructure
- Automatic token refresh

**Risk Level:** LOW (properly implemented)

---

### 5. XSS Protection ✅

**Protection Mechanisms:**
- ✅ React's built-in XSS protection (auto-escaping)
- ✅ No use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- ✅ All user input sanitized before rendering
- ✅ Content Security Policy ready (can be added to hosting)

**Risk Level:** LOW

---

### 6. CSRF Protection ✅

**Protection Mechanisms:**
- ✅ SPA architecture (no traditional form submissions)
- ✅ OAuth state parameter handling
- ✅ Google API handles CSRF tokens

**Risk Level:** LOW

---

### 7. Sensitive Data Exposure ✅

**Mitigations:**
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials
- ✅ Environment variables for all secrets
- ✅ Production logs don't expose sensitive data
- ✅ API keys restricted by domain
- ✅ Console logs conditional (dev only for sensitive info)

**Risk Level:** RESOLVED

## 📦 Dependency Security Analysis

### npm audit Results

**Total Vulnerabilities Found:** 9
- **High:** 6 (all in dev dependencies, not exploitable)
- **Moderate:** 3 (all in dev dependencies, not exploitable)

### Detailed Analysis

#### 1. nth-check (High)
- **Package:** `nth-check <2.0.1`
- **Used by:** `svgo` → `@svgr/webpack` → `react-scripts`
- **Type:** Development dependency
- **Impact:** ReDoS vulnerability
- **Exploitable in Production:** ❌ NO
- **Reason:** Only used during build time, not in runtime code
- **Recommendation:** Monitor for updates, not urgent

#### 2. postcss (Moderate)
- **Package:** `postcss <8.4.31`
- **Used by:** `resolve-url-loader` → `react-scripts`
- **Type:** Development dependency
- **Impact:** Line return parsing error
- **Exploitable in Production:** ❌ NO
- **Reason:** Build-time only
- **Recommendation:** Update when CRA updates

#### 3. webpack-dev-server (Moderate)
- **Package:** `webpack-dev-server <=5.2.0`
- **Type:** Development dependency
- **Impact:** Source code theft in malicious scenarios
- **Exploitable in Production:** ❌ NO
- **Reason:** Dev server not used in production builds
- **Recommendation:** Not a production risk

### Dependency Audit Decision

**Status:** ✅ ACCEPTABLE FOR PRODUCTION

**Rationale:**
- All vulnerabilities are in development dependencies
- None affect production runtime code
- Production build (`npm run build`) doesn't include these packages
- Build output is clean and minified

**Action Plan:**
- Monitor for `react-scripts` updates
- Consider migrating to Vite/Next.js in future for better dependency management
- Run `npm audit` monthly
